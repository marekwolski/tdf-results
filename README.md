# Tour de France Results

Since 2012 I have been keeping a spreadsheet of results from each year's Tour de France. For each year there's also a worksheet for the Teams and Riders and another for the Stages.

I plan to use Obsidian now for this sort of thing so I thought it might be fun and useful to extend my Python skills to extract the data from the XLS file and convert it into markdown files. So that's what this little project and repo are all about.

See [[docs/READMORE.md]] in the docs folder.
